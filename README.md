# Finding top 5 relevant question and answer based on User Input
Verdict top 5 relevant questions and answers based on user input

## Business Objective
In any website or in ecommerce business there are very few FAQ or limited user review. All the questions cannot be shown in website as website will look clumsy. Due to limited exposure of the questions, there is a possibility that user might not find question and the answer He/ She is searching for or the question is not present or never have been asked.
Considering different scenarios, we are proposing a model which will take user question and will bring out relevant top five question and answer from Question Bank.  
Our model ensures that:
- User will get relevant answer for the question he/ she is searching for 
- All the process is happening at server side and only top 5 result is achieved, website will not be clumsy.

## Problem statment

## Data
